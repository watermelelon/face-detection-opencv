# EyeQ - Face Detection with OpenCV
EyeQ is a computer vision project that uses facial landmark detection to monitor eye activity and explore signs of drowsiness or low alertness.
This project is the foundation for building a system that can detect when someone is getting sleepy and respond with helpful actions or alerts.

## Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python FaceDetectionPointsDemo.py
